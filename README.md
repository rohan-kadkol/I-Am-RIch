# I Am Rich

This is a Flutter app I worked on following the starter code from the [Flutter Udemy course by Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/).

It just displays an image of a diamond.

Skills learned:

1. General feel of Flutter
2. Using NetworkImage and AssetImage
